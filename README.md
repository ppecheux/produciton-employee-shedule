## algorithms

You will find algorithm implementations in the algos folder

When you want to implement something:

- implement a test in the file /tests/test_stations.py
- implement the function in algos/ stations.py (many simple tests are better than a bigger one) take a look at the unittest library for python
- run the test file to test the implementation of your function.
